- discrepancy with schedule in the email vs. IT material website (with people trying to keep us to the latter and us not being clear that the latter is guideline)
- making clear that we will stick to start and stop times and we will have breaks but we may not stick to the liter schedule in the IT materials
- having timing in IT materials is confusing and most often not a reflaction of reality - I'd suggest removing it (it is actually removed from the new lesson template)
- having 1 15-minute break is not enough
- 2 full days are really hard, especially online - for everyone (no time to do any work or manage caring duties for anyone)
- the first teaching demo exercise is at the end of Day 1 and often gets squashed - we had to move it for the start of Day 2
- having 3rd instructor was absolutely wonderful
