- discrepancy with schedule in the email vs. IT material website (with people trying to keep us to the latter and us not being clear that the latter is guideline)
- people not reading prep instructions properly - also some repetition in email that gets sent to participants and website but not exactly the same and consistent
- in prep instructions on the website it says 'not to spend more than 20-30' on prep - this is confusing and puts unnecessary pressure on people where it is meant to relax them - this time is not enough to rpepar just to read the lesson itself 
- 5 minutes not enough to sign up to demo and doscussion etherpads - people using screen readers can hardly read and make sense of those pads and it is the same for the others - suggest diving 10 minutes or just asking people to do this after the workshop
- too many links shared in checkout and how we operate epsodes - learners are lost
- making clear that we will stick to start and stop times and we will have breaks but we may not stick to the liter schedule in the IT materials
- having timing in IT materials is confusing and most often not a reflaction of reality - I'd suggest removing it (it is actually removed from the new lesson template)
- having 1 15-minute break is not enough
- 2 full days are really hard, especially online - for everyone (no time to do any work or manage caring duties for anyone)
- the first teaching demo exercise is at the end of Day 1 and often gets squashed - we had to move it for the start of Day 2
- having 3rd instructor was absolutely wonderful
